Project Proposal: 
FIFA 21 Player Analysis Using Python 

Introduction: 
This project focuses on analyzing player performance and market value using data from FIFA 
21. Football is a global sport, and understanding player attributes is critical for team managers, 
analysts, and fans. Using the FIFA 21 dataset, we aim to explore trends in player skills, identify 
factors that drive market value, and predict future potential. 

Research Questions: 
1. What attributes most significantly impact a player’s overall rating (OVA)? 
2. How do physical, technical, and mental attributes influence a player's market value and 
wage? 
3. Are there noticeable trends in player characteristics across positions, such as 
attackers, defenders, and goalkeepers? 
4. Can we predict a player’s future potential (POT) or growth based on their current 
statistics?

Data Description: 
The dataset contains detailed information on FIFA 21 players, including: 
• Personal Details: Name, Age, Nationality, Club, Position. 
• Performance Metrics: Overall rating (OVA), Potential (POT), and Growth. 
• Skill Attributes: Dribbling, Passing, Finishing, Ball Control, etc. 
• Physical Attributes: Acceleration, Speed, Strength, and Stamina. 
• Economic Details: Value, Wage, and Contract Details. 
This diverse dataset provides a solid foundation for analysis and machine learning models.
